    <string name="txt_desc">Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the
hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the
European rabbit species and its descendants, the world\'s 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit.
Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The
European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar
throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet.
With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas
of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic
inspiration.</string>
